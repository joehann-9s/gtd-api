# GTD (Getting Things Done)
<sub><sup>*GTD is an activity management method created by David Allen.</sup></sub>

GTD is a tiny personal application, which I started 'cause I was searching out for methods to organize my tasks.
When I found this one, I liked how it worked , and wanted to customize it into my own interface and functionality.

At the beginning I was a bit hesitant, I wanted to integrate it, into a larger app (which one was not finished, yet). But I took the decision to make it, like a practice project with GO (programming language that I'm studying). With the aim of that when I finish it, it will help me to finish my other projects that are in stand by.
